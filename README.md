# Blackpearl QA Technical Test 

 

## Introduction 

The following technical test is to assess the candidateâ€™s approach to automated testing. It requires the scaffolding of a testing framework which will allow them to interact with the DOM and wait for responses/pages to load.

## Credentials 

A username, password, and application URL will be sent to you with the link to this repository. 

## Requirements 

The candidate is expected to spend **no longer than 2 hours** on the technical test. Incomplete tests can be a valid submission and will be evaluated on approach and coding standards rather than completion of the task. Please create a new repository on GitHub and share the results of your work. Please remember to create an initial commit when you begin and to commit often so we can see how you work.

## Outputs 

- Load the login page. 
- Interact with the interface to change to the username/password version of the login page. 
- Input the username and password into their corresponding fields.
- Click the login button to proceed to the logged-in state.
- Check that there is a loaded user number on the dashboard (the content needs to be present but could be a changing value)

 > Note: While your code doesn't need to be complete it does need to run/compile and your repository should NOT contain any credentials committed in code, it should support us running it with credentials to test your work.
